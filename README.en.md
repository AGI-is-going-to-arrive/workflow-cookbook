> **"Warp it with the heavens, weft it with the earth."** — *Zuo Zhuan* (4th c. BCE)
>
> Two millennia ago, weavers built brocade thread by thread: the **warp** runs lengthwise — the structure, fixed and unmovable; the **weft** shuttles across — the function, ever-changing. Warp and weft interlace, and only then is there cloth.
>
> Orchestrating AI agents is the same: `meta` and `phase` are the warp — the deterministic skeleton; `agent()` and `pipeline()` are the weft — the intelligent units that shuttle through it. Interlace them, and you have a pipeline.
>
> **While everyone else hand-conducts their agents, this book teaches you to make them form up on their own.**

## What this book is about

Claude Code's **Workflow** feature (availability controlled by the feature flag `CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS`; once it's available, from v2.1.154 you can also use `/effort ultracode` to make Claude orchestrate proactively by default for the session) is an engine for **deterministically orchestrating multiple agents** with a JavaScript script. It is not MCP, not Skills, not Subagents, not Agent Teams — it is a new kind of engineering pipeline that is **reusable, testable, and shareable**.

This book takes you from zero to one: understand its essential positioning → master the full `agent()`/`parallel()`/`pipeline()`/`schema` API → work through 7 really-run recipes → unlock advanced patterns like adversarial verification / loop-until-dry / budget / resume → benchmark the four major community systems and extract their essence → build your own Workflow library → and master the full author → validate → debug flow from intent to ship.

> **This is not API documentation — it's a hands-on Cookbook. Approachable, and grounded in real runs: recipes that were actually run carry their Run ID and usage; scripts shown only for illustration are clearly marked.**

> **Verification statement:** Every API description in this book is cross-checked word-for-word against the type definitions (`WorkflowInput`/`WorkflowOutput`) in Claude Code's official distribution package `sdk-tools.d.ts`; every output marked "real run" comes from actually executing a Workflow in a real session, and each is traceable in `assets/transcripts/`. Scripts that were not really run and are shown only for illustration are clearly labeled as such.

## Run your first Workflow in Claude Code

```javascript
export const meta = {
  name: 'hello-workflow',
  description: 'Smoke test: one subagent returns schema-constrained structured output',
  phases: [{ title: 'Greet', detail: 'One subagent confirms the runtime' }],
}

phase('Greet')
const r = await agent(
  'You are a smoke test for the Claude Code Workflow runtime. Return a one-sentence ' +
  'confirmation message, the integer value of 2+2, and a boolean confirming you ran ' +
  'as a workflow subagent.',
  {
    label: 'smoke',
    schema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        message: { type: 'string' },
        sum: { type: 'number' },
        runtimeConfirmed: { type: 'boolean' },
      },
      required: ['message', 'sum', 'runtimeConfirmed'],
    },
  }
)
log(`smoke result: ${JSON.stringify(r)}`)
return r
```

> **How to run it (important):** this is a **Workflow script**, not a standalone Node script — `export`/`meta`/`phase`/`agent`/`log` are global symbols injected by the Workflow runtime. **Running it with `node hello.js` immediately throws `phase is not defined` (on Windows and macOS alike).** The correct way: inside a Claude Code session with the **feature flag enabled** (`CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS=1 claude`, or set it in the `env` of `~/.claude/settings.json`), just ask Claude to execute it — e.g. include the keyword `workflow` in your message (like "run this workflow"), and Claude invokes the built-in Workflow tool.
>
> Real return (`schema` forces structure; `sum` is the integer `4`, not a string): `{"message":"…","sum":4,"runtimeConfirmed":true}` (Run `wf_dacbd480-d5d`, 1 agent / 26,338 tokens / 5.5s).
