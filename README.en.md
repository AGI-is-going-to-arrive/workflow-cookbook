> **"Warp it with the heavens, weft it with the earth."** (*Zuo Zhuan*, 4th c. BCE)
>
> Two millennia ago, weavers built brocade thread by thread. The **warp** runs lengthwise: it is the structure, fixed and unmovable. The **weft** shuttles across: it is the function, ever-changing. Warp and weft interlace, and only then is there cloth.
>
> Orchestrating AI agents works the same way. `meta` and `phase` are the warp, the deterministic skeleton. `agent()` and `pipeline()` are the weft, the intelligent units that shuttle through it. Interlace them, and you have a pipeline.

> **While everyone else hand-conducts their agents, this book teaches you to make them form up on their own.**

## What this book is about

**Dynamic workflows** is Claude Code's engine for **deterministically orchestrating multiple agents** with a JavaScript script. You turn it on from the "Dynamic workflows" row in `/config`; under the hood that toggle maps to the `CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS=1` flag, which power users can also set directly. Once it's available, from v2.1.154 you can use `/effort ultracode` to make Claude orchestrate proactively by default for the session. Dynamic workflows stands apart from MCP, Skills, Subagents, and Agent Teams. It is a new kind of engineering pipeline that is **reusable, testable, and shareable**.

This book covers the full path from zero to one: understanding where Workflow sits among the extension mechanisms, mastering the full `agent()`/`parallel()`/`pipeline()`/`schema` API, and working through 7 real-run recipes. It then covers advanced patterns like adversarial verification, loop-until-dry, budget, and resume, benchmarks the four major community systems and extracts their strengths, guides building your own Workflow library, and walks through the complete author, validate, and debug flow from intent to ship.

> **This is a hands-on Cookbook, not API documentation. Every recipe is grounded in real runs. Recipes that were actually run carry their Run ID and usage; scripts shown only for illustration are clearly marked.**

> **Verification statement:** Every API description in this book is cross-checked word-for-word against the type definitions (`WorkflowInput`/`WorkflowOutput`) in Claude Code's official distribution package `sdk-tools.d.ts`; every output marked "real run" comes from actually executing a Workflow in a real session, and each is traceable in `assets/transcripts/`. Scripts that were not really run and are shown only for illustration are clearly labeled as such.

## Run your first Workflow in Claude Code

```javascript
export const meta = {
  name: 'hello-workflow',
  description: 'Smoke test: one subagent returns schema-constrained structured output',
  phases: [{ title: 'Greet', detail: 'One subagent confirms the runtime' }],
}

phase('Greet')
const r = await agent(
  'You are a smoke test for the Claude Code Workflow runtime. Return a one-sentence ' +
  'confirmation message, the integer value of 2+2, and a boolean confirming you ran ' +
  'as a workflow subagent.',
  {
    label: 'smoke',
    schema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        message: { type: 'string' },
        sum: { type: 'number' },
        runtimeConfirmed: { type: 'boolean' },
      },
      required: ['message', 'sum', 'runtimeConfirmed'],
    },
  }
)
log(`smoke result: ${JSON.stringify(r)}`)
return r
```

> **How to run it (important):** this is a **Workflow script**, not a standalone Node script. `export`/`meta`/`phase`/`agent`/`log` are global symbols injected by the Workflow runtime. **Running it with `node hello.js` immediately throws `phase is not defined` (on Windows and macOS alike).** Run it inside a Claude Code session that has Workflow turned on. The official entry is the "Dynamic workflows" row in `/config`; on macOS or Linux a power user can also launch with `CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS=1 claude`, and on Windows (or for a persistent setting) you write that flag into the `env` of `~/.claude/settings.json`, a JSON form that works on every platform. Then just ask Claude to execute the script. For example, include the keyword `workflow` in your message (like "run this workflow"), and Claude invokes the built-in Workflow tool.
>
> Real return (`schema` forces structure; `sum` is the integer `4`, not a string): `{"message":"…","sum":4,"runtimeConfirmed":true}` (Run `wf_dacbd480-d5d`, 1 agent / 26,338 tokens / 5.5s).

## Repository layout

```
workflow-cookbook/
├─ docs/zh/          # Chinese book (plain Markdown, readable directly on GitHub)
├─ docs/en/          # full English mirror
├─ assets/
│  └─ transcripts/   # raw logs for 23 unique Run IDs (R4 baseline 17 + R5 application-level 3 + R6 application-level 3)
├─ index.html        # companion static site (Bright Editorial / Newspaper theme, client-side Markdown)
└─ manifest.json     # site table of contents and zh/en mapping
```

Docs and site are decoupled. `docs/` is the "book" in plain Markdown, and `index.html` is the rendering layer. There is zero build, so you can deploy it straight to GitHub Pages.

To preview locally: the page loads `docs/` at runtime with `fetch`, so opening it via `file://` gets blocked by the browser. Serve the repo root over HTTP instead. macOS/Linux: `python3 -m http.server 8000`; Windows: `python -m http.server 8000`; then open `http://localhost:8000`. (Or `npx serve` on any OS, and open the URL it prints.)
